If you‚Äôve ever peeked under the hood of medical imaging systems, you‚Äôve likely come across **DICOM** (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine). It‚Äôs the universal standard that allows medical devices, software, and systems to speak the same language when dealing with medical images.  
While DICOM is a broad and complex ecosystem, there are a few core concepts that are key to understanding how it works.

### 1\. Objects & Classes in DICOM

In DICOM, **objects** represent *real-world medical entities* (like an MRI scan, an ultrasound image, or a patient record).  
A **class** defines the rules, properties, and behaviors of these objects.  
For example:

* **Object**: John Doe‚Äôs CT scan from January 1, 2025.
    
* **Class**: CT Image Storage SOP Class, which defines how CT scan data should be structured and stored.
    

Think of it like this:

* **Class** = Blueprint
    
* **Object** = Actual house built from the blueprint.

### 2\. VR (Value Representation)

DICOM data is full of attributes ‚Äî patient name, image width, scan date, etc. **Value Representation (VR)** defines *how* each attribute‚Äôs data is formatted.  
Some VR examples:

* **PN** (Person Name) ‚Üí `Stephen^Maina`
    
* **DA** (Date) ‚Üí `20250815`
    
* **US** (Unsigned Short) ‚Üí `512`
    

In short: VR tells the system how to *interpret* each piece of data.

### 3\. DIMSE (DICOM Message Service Element)

DIMSE is the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù that DICOM devices use to request and share data over the network.  
It‚Äôs like the verbs in DICOM‚Äôs dictionary ‚Äî *Store this image*, *Retrieve that file*, *Find these patients*.

There are two main categories:

* **DIMSE-C** ‚Üí Commands for working with images and data over the network (Store, Query, Retrieve).
    
* **DIMSE-N** ‚Üí Commands for working with other non-image-related objects (modality worklists, printer settings).

### 4\. Communication Bits

At the networking level, DICOM relies on **communication bits** ‚Äî the smallest units of data transmission. This is where protocols like TCP/IP come in to ensure information is broken into binary sequences (0s and 1s) for transfer between systems.

You usually don‚Äôt touch this layer directly unless you‚Äôre working on very low-level integrations, but it‚Äôs the foundation that makes DICOM‚Äôs higher-level commands possible.

---

### 5\. Does This All Go Back to Coding?

Yes ‚Äî if you‚Äôre building, customizing, or integrating medical systems, you‚Äôll eventually deal with code.  
DICOM defines the rules, but it‚Äôs programming languages like Python, C++, or Java that bring these rules to life. For example:

* Parsing a DICOM file with a library like **pydicom** in Python.
    
* Implementing a DICOM Store SCP (Service Class Provider) in C++.
    
* Building a FHIR-DICOM bridge to send imaging data to EHR systems.
    

So while clinicians rarely touch DICOM code, developers live in it.

üí° **Final Takeaway**  
DICOM isn‚Äôt just a file format ‚Äî it‚Äôs a rich standard combining data structure, network protocols, and communication rules to ensure medical images are shared safely, accurately, and universally.
