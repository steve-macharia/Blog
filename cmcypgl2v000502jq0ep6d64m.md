In Kenya‚Äôs journey toward **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)**, one of the most pressing challenges is the lack of **interoperability** between healthcare systems. Across **county hospitals, clinics, and health programs**, patient information is often fragmented‚Äîtrapped in siloed Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), paper files, or disconnected databases.

This fragmentation slows down care, leads to poor decision-making, and ultimately affects patient outcomes. But there‚Äôs good news: **HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)** offers a powerful solution to **unlock better healthcare in Kenya**.

## What is FHIR?

**FHIR** is an international standard for exchanging healthcare data electronically in a **secure, structured, and standardized** way. Developed by **Health Level Seven International (HL7)**, FHIR makes it possible for different healthcare systems to **communicate and share data seamlessly**‚Äîno matter what software they use.

## Why Does FHIR Matter for Kenya?

In Kenya, where health services are delivered across diverse facilities‚Äîfrom small rural clinics to county referral hospitals‚Äîcare continuity is often disrupted by **inconsistent patient records**.

By adopting **FHIR in Kenya‚Äôs health systems**, we can:  
‚úÖ Enable **real-time data exchange** between different EMRs  
‚úÖ Improve **referral management and clinical workflows**  
‚úÖ Support **Ministry of Health (MOH) reporting** and health financing  
‚úÖ Empower **clinicians with complete patient histories** for better decision-making

## FHIR in Action: Bridging Health Systems

Imagine a patient who receives care at a rural clinic but later needs referral to a county hospital. Without interoperability, the hospital may have **no access to the patient's previous records**, leading to redundant tests, delays, or errors.

With **FHIR**, that same patient‚Äôs information‚Äîdemographics, diagnosis, prescriptions, and lab results‚Äîcan be **securely shared as FHIR resources** between the two facilities. This not only saves time and costs but also improves **patient safety and outcomes**.
