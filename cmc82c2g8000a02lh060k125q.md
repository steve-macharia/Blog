A miscalculated Body Mass Index (BMI) in an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system falsely tagged an obese patient as malnourished.

> The cause? A silent, untested assumption in the logic.
> 
> The result? Incorrect clinical decisions.

## 🩻 The Faulty Scenario

In a typical patient intake workflow, the system asks for:

* **Weight (kg)**
    
* **Height (cm)**
    

The nurse records:

* `Weight: 90`
    
* `Height: 160`
    

The EMR system then performs:

```plaintext
textCopyEditBMI = weight / (height²)
```

But here’s the problem:  
The height is **in centimetres**, but the BMI formula assumes **metres**.

So the calculation becomes:

```plaintext
textCopyEditBMI = 90 / (160²) = 90 / 25600 = 0.0035 ❌
```

Instead of:

```plaintext
textCopyEditBMI = 90 / (1.6²) = 90 / 2.56 = 35.16 ✅
```

This miscalculated BMI (≪ 10) triggered a **malnutrition alert**, which in reality was not warranted. The patient was clinically obese, not undernourished.

## 📉 Root Cause Analysis

### 1\. **Mismatch Between UI Expectations and Business Logic**

* Frontend accepts height in cm
    
* Backend formula expects metres
    
* No unit conversion applied between layers
    

### 2\. **Lack of Input Validation**

* No lower or upper bounds for acceptable BMI
    
* No checks to verify height/weight entries are within expected physiological ranges
    

### 3\. **Missing Test Cases**

* No boundary tests for:
    
    * Height in unexpected units
        
    * BMI values near clinical thresholds
        
    * Outlier detection (e.g., BMI &lt; 10 or &gt; 60)
        

---

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### 🔹 Unit Conversion Verification

Before BMI calculation, ensure conversion:

```plaintext
pythonCopyEdit# Example in Python
height_cm = 160
height_m = height_cm / 100
bmi = weight / (height_m ** 2)
```

Automated tests should verify:

* Correct conversion logic
    
* Acceptance of only valid units
    

---

### 🔹 Boundary Value Testing for BMI Logic

Create test cases for BMI edges:

```plaintext
jsonCopyEdit[
  {"weight": 45, "height": 170, "expected_bmi": 15.6},
  {"weight": 90, "height": 160, "expected_bmi": 35.2},
  {"weight": 120, "height": 165, "expected_bmi": 44.1},
  {"weight": 70, "height": 0, "expect_error": true},
  {"weight": 100, "height": -175, "expect_error": true}
]
```

Ensure the system:

* Flags BMI &lt; 12 as suspicious
    
* Flags BMI &gt; 60 for verification
    
* Blocks zero or negative heights
    

---

### 🔹 Validation Layer for Clinical Ranges

BMI values should be clinically constrained:

| BMI Value | Status | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| &lt;12 | Clinically invalid | Require input recheck |
| 12–18.5 | Underweight | Allow, but warn |
| 18.5–24.9 | Normal | Pass |
| 25–29.9 | Overweight | Pass |
| 30–60 | Obese | Pass |
| \&gt;60 | Invalid | Require manual review |

---

### 🔹 Integration Testing with Frontend

Validate that:

* UI explicitly labels unit expectations (`cm`, not `m`)
    
* Backend interprets the units correctly
    
* Alerts (malnutrition, obesity, etc.) are triggered based on **accurate BMI only**
    

---

## 🚨 Clinical Risk

Incorrect BMI classification can result in:

* Inaccurate diagnoses
    
* Misguided nutritional interventions
    
* Mistaken health insurance decisions
    
* Erosion of patient trust due to visible contradictions
    

In health IT, bugs don’t just break code. They **break care**.

---

## 🧰 EMR Developer Checklist (BMI Module)

* Enforce unit standardization (e.g., convert cm → m)
    
* Clamp input to safe physiological ranges
    
* Write test cases for both valid and outlier BMI
    
* Auto-warn on extreme or illogical BMI values
    
* Prevent BMI-based tags from triggering alerts unless value is validated
    
* Include logs for BMI logic failures and outliers
    

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

BMI calculation may seem trivial, but when integrated into critical clinical workflows, even one assumption — like unit mismatches — can lead to gross misclassification.

If you're building or testing EMR systems:

> **Validate everything. Especially what looks obvious.**

The system may be technically correct… and clinically wrong.
