If you've ever worked on a PHP project with multiple contributors (or used a framework like Laravel or Symfony), chances are you've benefited from **PSR** — even if you didn’t know it.

But what exactly **is PSR**, and why should PHP developers care?

---

## 📘 What is PSR?

**PSR** stands for **PHP Standard Recommendation**. It’s a collection of guidelines published by the PHP-FIG (PHP Framework Interop Group) to standardize coding practices and interoperability between PHP projects.

These standards help developers and frameworks "speak the same language," making it easier to share code, understand libraries, and contribute to open-source.

## 🔢 The Most Common PSRs You Should Know

Here are some of the most widely adopted PSRs in the PHP world:

### 🔹 PSR-1: Basic Coding Standard

Defines the foundation for code style:

* Files should use `<?php` or `<?=`
    
* Class names must be in **StudlyCaps**
    
* Method names must be in **camelCase**
    
* Files should only define classes, functions, or constants — or perform side effects (not both)
    

👉 Think of PSR-1 as the bare minimum for writing "clean" PHP code.

---

### 🔹 PSR-2: Coding Style Guide *(Deprecated in favor of PSR-12)*

Builds on PSR-1 and adds formatting rules:

* Use 4 spaces for indentation
    
* Opening braces on a new line
    
* One class per file
    
* Visibility (`public`, `private`) must be declared
    

---

### 🔹 PSR-12: Extended Coding Style

This is the **modern replacement for PSR-2**, supporting new PHP features (like `typed properties`, `nullable types`, etc.).

* Based on PSR-1 and PSR-2, but modernized
    
* Enforces consistent formatting for newer syntax
    
* Widely supported by tools like `PHP_CodeSniffer` and `PHP-CS-Fixer`
    

---

### 🔹 PSR-4: Autoloading Standard

Defines how to map **namespaces** to **file paths**:

```plaintext
jsonCopyEdit{
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "App\\": "src/"
    }
  }
}
```

PSR-4 is what powers modern autoloading in Composer. Without it, you'd be stuck manually including every file.

---

### 🔹 PSR-3: Logger Interface

Standardizes how libraries handle logging. You can use a logging library like [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) that adheres to PSR-3 and easily swap it later with another one.

```plaintext
phpCopyEdit$logger->info('User logged in');
$logger->error('Something broke');
```

---

### 🔹 PSR-7: HTTP Messages

Defines interfaces for HTTP requests and responses. It's the backbone of modern microframeworks and middleware, like Slim or Laminas.

---

## 🚀 Why Should You Use PSR?

* ✅ **Consistency**: Makes your code easier to read, maintain, and refactor.
    
* 🔄 **Interoperability**: Easily integrate third-party packages that follow the same standards.
    
* 👥 **Collaboration**: Teams can work more efficiently with shared conventions.
    
* 📦 **Modern Tools**: Tools like Composer, PHPStan, Psalm, and PHP-CS-Fixer are built around PSR compliance.

## ⚙️ Tools to Help You Stick to PSRs

* [**PHP\_CodeSniffer**](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) — checks your code for PSR compliance
    
* [**PHP-CS-Fixer**](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) — automatically formats code to match PSR standards
    
* **PHPStan** and **Psalm** — static analysis tools that enforce best practices

## 📦 Real-World Example: Composer and PSR-4

```plaintext
jsonCopyEdit{
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "App\\Controllers\\": "app/Controllers/"
    }
  }
}
```

When you run:

```plaintext
bashCopyEditcomposer dump-autoload
```

It tells Composer how to map class files to directories — so `App\Controllers\UserController` maps to `app/Controllers/UserController.php`.

That’s PSR-4 in action.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

You don’t need to memorize every PSR — but understanding the most common ones will drastically improve your PHP workflow. Whether you're working on a personal project or contributing to open-source, following PSRs helps you write **cleaner**, **more maintainable**, and **future-proof** PHP code.

> ✨ Embrace the standard. The future of PHP is collaborative.
