In today’s fast-paced healthcare environment, **efficient laboratory information management** is crucial for accurate diagnosis, timely treatment, and public health monitoring. Enter **OpenELIS (Open Enterprise Laboratory Information System)** — a powerful, open-source solution designed to streamline laboratory workflows from sample collection to result reporting.

## What is OpenELIS?

OpenELIS is an **open-source laboratory information management system (LIMS)** developed to handle laboratory data efficiently, especially in public health settings. Its modular architecture allows healthcare facilities to customize the system according to their needs, whether managing routine diagnostic labs or national-level public health programs.

Unlike commercial LIMS, OpenELIS is **free, flexible, and community-supported**, making it ideal for low- and middle-income countries, rural health facilities, and research labs.

## Installing OpenELIS

For those looking to implement OpenELIS natively (without Docker), the system requires:

* **Java (OpenJDK 11 or higher)**
    
* **Maven** for building the project
    
* **PostgreSQL** for database management
    
* **Tomcat 9** as the application server
    

A fully working **bash script** can automate installation, setup the database, and deploy OpenELIS on Tomcat without manual intervention — ideal for busy IT teams. Using SSH for cloning the GitHub repository ensures the installation process runs smoothly **without prompting for credentials**.

## OpenELIS in Action

Across the globe, OpenELIS is powering **national and regional laboratories**, especially in countries where cost and flexibility are major considerations. For example:

* **Public Health Surveillance:** Tracking infectious diseases and reporting outbreaks.
    
* **Clinical Diagnostics:** Managing patient test results efficiently in hospitals and clinics.
    
* **Research Labs:** Handling complex workflows for studies and trials.
    

Its open-source nature encourages innovation — developers can extend features, integrate new tests, or improve reporting standards according to evolving healthcare needs.
