**Meta Description (SEO):**  
Learn how to use Wireshark to capture, inspect, and troubleshoot HL7 v2 messages over MLLP. A step-by-step guide for healthcare IT and interoperability engineers.

## 🔎 Why Use Wireshark for HL7 v2 Troubleshooting?

If you work in **healthcare interoperability**, chances are you’ve dealt with **HL7 v2 messages** — ADT, ORU, ORM, and more. These messages often travel over **TCP/IP using MLLP (Minimal Lower Layer Protocol)**.

But when messages don’t arrive or ACKs go missing, you need a way to look at the **raw HL7 traffic**. That’s where **Wireshark** comes in.

With Wireshark, you can:

* Capture HL7 messages directly on the network.
    
* Confirm that **ACK/NACK responses** are being exchanged.
    
* Troubleshoot **framing, version mismatch, and dropped messages**.
    
* Learn the flow of HL7 in real-time.

## 🛠️ Capturing HL7 Messages with Wireshark

Most HL7 v2 interfaces use a custom port (commonly `2575` or `5000`). To capture HL7 traffic, open Wireshark and apply a filter:

```plaintext
tcp port 2575
```

This ensures you only capture HL7 v2 traffic.

## 📡 Following an HL7 Message Stream

Once captured, right-click a TCP packet → **Follow → TCP Stream**.

Here’s an example **HL7 ORU^R01 message**:

```plaintext
MSH|^~\&|LAB|HOSPITAL|EHR|HOSPITAL|202509171245||ORU^R01|12345|P|2.5
PID|1||123456^^^HOSP^MR||Doe^John||19800101|M
OBR|1||54321|CBC^Complete Blood Count
OBX|1|NM|WBC^White Blood Cells||5.4|10^9/L|4.0-10.0|N
```

Followed by an **ACK**:

```plaintext
MSH|^~\&|EHR|HOSPITAL|LAB|HOSPITAL|202509171246||ACK^R01|12345|P|2.5
MSA|AA|12345
```

This confirms successful delivery.

## 🚨 Common HL7 Problems Wireshark Helps Solve

1. **Missing ACKs** → Receiver not responding or rejecting silently.
    
2. **Framing Errors** → Missing `0x0B` or `0x1C0D` MLLP wrappers.
    
3. **Dropped Messages** → TCP resets or retransmissions.
    
4. **HL7 Version Mismatch** → Sender uses 2.3, receiver expects 2.5.1.
    
5. **Encoding Issues** → UTF-8 vs ANSI causing garbled characters.

## ⚡ Pro Tips for HL7 Debugging in Wireshark

* Use **Display Filters** to isolate a stream:
    

```plaintext
tcp.stream eq 2
```

* Export HL7 payloads for validation using:
    
    * HL7 Inspector
        
    * HAPI Test Panel
        
* Integrate with **Mirth Connect** or other integration engines for side-by-side raw vs parsed view.
