## 💥 Introduction

While PHP developers are often mindful of runtime exceptions, **constructor failures are a silent landmine** in production environments. This article shares a case scenario based on a real-world PHP EMR module where a database constructor failure caused complete application downtime. If you're using PDO or injecting services in constructors, this may already be happening in your app—especially in Kenya's growing digital health ecosystem.

---

## 🧨 The Scenario: Fatal Crash from a Failed Constructor

A hospital's EMR system includes a widget for showing daily patient visits. It's backed by a `DbConnector` class:

```php
class DbConnector {
    private $pdo;

    public function __construct($dsn, $user, $pass) {
        $this->pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass);  // This line can throw
    }

    public function query($sql) {
        return $this->pdo->query($sql);
    }
}
```

During a deployment, the `config.ini` file was updated with **invalid database credentials**.

In the dashboard widget:

```php
$connector = new DbConnector($dsn, $user, $pass);
$stats = $connector->query("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM patient_records");
```

Instead of a graceful failure, the application **crashed with a fatal error**:

```plaintext
Fatal error: Uncaught PDOException: SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user
```

The whole dashboard went blank. Logs filled with fatal error traces, and users experienced immediate outage—potentially impacting continuity of care in busy health centers, including those digitizing health records across counties in Kenya.

## 🔍 Root Cause

* **PDO constructor throws exceptions** on failure (e.g., auth issues, unreachable DB)
    
* PHP does not allow constructors to return null or false
    
* No `try/catch` block was used to guard against failure
    

The application assumed that object construction would always succeed—an unsafe assumption in real-world systems.

---

## ✅ Best Practice: Guard Constructor Instantiation

### 🔐 Wrap with try/catch

```php
try {
    $connector = new DbConnector($dsn, $user, $pass);
    $stats = $connector->query("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM patient_records");
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    error_log("DB error: " . $e->getMessage());
    echo "<p>System is temporarily unavailable.</p>";
}
```

### 💡 Bonus: Lazy Initialization

Avoid connecting in the constructor at all:

```php
class DbConnector {
    private $pdo = null;
    private $dsn, $user, $pass;

    public function __construct($dsn, $user, $pass) {
        $this->dsn = $dsn;
        $this->user = $user;
        $this->pass = $pass;
    }

    private function connect() {
        if ($this->pdo === null) {
            $this->pdo = new PDO($this->dsn, $this->user, $this->pass);
        }
    }

    public function query($sql) {
        $this->connect();
        return $this->pdo->query($sql);
    }
}
```

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

* ✅ Always assume constructors can fail when they depend on external services (DBs, APIs)
    
* ❌ Never wrap risky logic in a constructor without error handling
    
* 🧪 Use dependency injection containers or factories for safe service creation
    
* 🩺 In EMR and health systems—especially those serving national digital health programs—failure in a constructor can delay clinical work and jeopardize care

## 📌 Final Thoughts

PHP may not enforce typed constructors or checked exceptions, but real-world experience shows that constructors are just as capable of breaking your app. By handling failures early and designing constructors defensively, you make your system more resilient.

If you're building EMRs or health applications across Africa or in Kenya's expanding digital health landscape, don’t let a simple PDO exception paralyze your platform. Wrap it. Test it. Guard it.
