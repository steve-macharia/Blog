### üîß **IG Purpose**

To represent **computable oncology guidelines** used in Kenya‚Äôs healthcare system, particularly for use in EMRs (like Jali-EMR, OpenEMR), HAPI FHIR servers, and decision support systems in line with:

* Kenya Cancer Policy 2020‚Äì2030
    
* National Cancer Control Strategy 2023‚Äì2027
    
* SHA patient ID model
    
* Local ICD-10 codes (Kenya does **not** use SNOMED/LOINC)

## ‚úÖ IG Structure Outline

### 1\. **Canonical URL**

```plaintext
bashCopyEdithttp://health.go.ke/fhir/ImplementationGuide/oncology-cpg-kenya
```

---

### 2\. **Profiles Used (Based on CPG IG)**

| FHIR Resource | Purpose | Kenya Context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PlanDefinition` | Represents high-level CPG (e.g., cervical cancer treatment) | Based on MoH protocols |
| `ActivityDefinition` | Steps like ordering biopsy, imaging, chemo | Modeled on KEMRI & County Hospital flow |
| `Library` | Logic and decision support rules (e.g., if Stage II, then chemo) | Written in CQL or ELM |
| `GuidanceResponse` | Output of CDS execution | Triggered in OpenEMR |
| `CarePlan` | Patient-specific application of CPG | Linked to `OncologyKenyaCarePlan` |
| `RequestGroup` | Set of activities generated by CDS | Execution bundle |
| `Evidence` / `EvidenceVariable` | Justification for recommendation | Can link to Kenyan studies or WHO resources |
| `Questionnaire` / `Response` | For capturing symptom/risk factors | Based on screening protocols |
