If you’ve ever wondered what happens when you visit an HTTP site in Chrome, here’s the scoop — and why it’s critical if you’re dealing with sensitive data like **bearer tokens**.

## Chrome’s HTTPS-First Approach

Modern Chrome versions try to connect to the **HTTPS version** of every site first. This is called **HTTPS-First Mode**. If the secure version exists, Chrome will automatically use it, keeping your data encrypted.

## When HTTPS Isn’t Available

If a site only supports HTTP, Chrome will still load it but clearly marks it as **“Not Secure”** in the address bar. You’ll see a warning: *“Your connection to this site is not secure. Do not enter sensitive information.”*

## Mixed Content and HSTS

* **Mixed content:** If an HTTPS page loads some resources over HTTP, Chrome may block or warn about it.
    
* **HSTS:** Some sites enforce HTTPS strictly. Chrome remembers this via HSTS, refusing any HTTP connections.
    

## Why This Matters for Bearer Tokens

A **bearer token** is like a magic key — anyone who has it can access your resources. Sending it over HTTP is risky because it’s **unencrypted** and can be intercepted by attackers. Always ensure your site shows the **padlock icon and** `https://` before sending sensitive tokens.

✅ **Rule of Thumb:** Treat bearer tokens like cash — only share them over **HTTPS** and store them securely.
