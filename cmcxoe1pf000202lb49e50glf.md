In today’s fast-evolving healthcare landscape, digital technologies like electronic health records (EHRs), mobile health apps, telemedicine, and artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming how care is delivered. These tools promise faster diagnoses, better treatment outcomes, and wider access to healthcare services. However, alongside this transformation comes a critical ethical responsibility: the need to **report software bugs** when they are discovered.

In digital health, not reporting a bug is not just a technical oversight—it is **an ethical failure** that can directly or indirectly put patient safety at serious risk.

## Why Bug Reporting in Digital Health Matters

Unlike in other industries where a software glitch might only lead to inconvenience or financial loss, in healthcare, even a small digital error can lead to **life-threatening consequences**:

* A bug in a clinical decision support system could recommend the wrong medication dosage.
    
* A crash in an Electronic Health Record system could result in missing vital information during emergency care.
    
* A patient portal malfunction could delay follow-up care for serious conditions.
    

At **Medby Tech**, we work with healthcare providers across Kenya and beyond to develop digital solutions that enhance patient care, such as **Jali-EMR**—a comprehensive electronic medical record system designed to support safer, smarter, and more efficient care delivery ([https://medbytech.com](https://medby-tech.netlify.app/)). In our experience, we have seen how even minor system glitches, when left unreported, can compromise patient safety and erode trust in digital health.

A study by Westbrook et al. (2017) showed that malfunctions in health information technology (HIT) systems contributed to medication errors and patient harm. This demonstrates that digital health errors are not hypothetical—they are **real-world risks** with real-world consequences.

## The Ethical Foundation: “Do No Harm”

The fundamental ethical principle of **non-maleficence**—to “do no harm”—is central to healthcare practice. In the digital health era, this principle extends beyond bedside care to the very systems that enable and support that care.

Failing to report a known software issue violates this ethical standard. It allows potential risks to persist in environments where patients may suffer preventable harm. Ethically, this is no different from ignoring faulty medical equipment or unsafe clinical practices.

## The Hidden Costs of Staying Silent

The dangers of not reporting bugs in healthcare technology include:

### 1\. **Patient Harm**

Mistakes in treatment, wrong diagnoses, missed follow-ups, or adverse drug events can arise from digital system errors that go unreported and unfixed.

### 2\. **Loss of Trust**

Patients, clinicians, and administrators must have confidence in the safety of digital systems like **Jali-EMR**. When errors are hidden or ignored, this trust erodes, potentially slowing down the adoption of life-saving innovations.

### 3\. **Legal and Regulatory Risks**

In regulated environments, failure to address known software issues can result in legal action, penalties, or even loss of licensure for healthcare organizations or software vendors.

## Ethical Action: A Shared Responsibility

At **Medby Tech**, we believe that building ethical, patient-centered digital health systems means everyone—developers, IT teams, clinicians, and administrators—has a shared moral obligation to report bugs and system vulnerabilities.

To uphold this responsibility:

* Foster an **open and transparent culture** where bug reporting is encouraged and valued.
    
* Educate all users on how to recognize and report issues in systems like **Jali-EMR**.
    
* Ensure reported bugs are acted upon swiftly and effectively to prevent harm.

## Reporting Bugs is a Moral Duty

Bug reporting in digital health is not merely a technical matter—it is an **ethical act** that protects patients. Choosing silence when a system flaw is known is choosing to allow a preventable risk to continue.

At **Medby Tech**, our mission is not just to innovate but to safeguard lives through trustworthy, ethical, and responsive technology like **Jali-EMR**. We invite all users, partners, and healthcare professionals to join us in building a digital health environment where safety, integrity, and accountability come first.

Remember: If you see something wrong—**report it**. Because in healthcare, even the smallest unreported bug can lead to the biggest consequences.
