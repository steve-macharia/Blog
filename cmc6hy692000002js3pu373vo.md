**Tags:** `#FHIR` `#HL7v2` `#DigitalHealth` `#MirthConnect` `#KenyaEMR`

In real-world digital health implementation, data isn’t just about what’s present — it’s also about what’s missing *intentionally*. In this post, I’ll break down a subtle but dangerous failure we encountered while integrating a Kenyan EMR with a Mirth-powered FHIR pipeline.

The root cause?  
`dosage=0` was interpreted as *null* — and patients kept receiving medications they were supposed to stop.

---

## 💊 The Real-World Scenario

We were integrating a medication order workflow between:

* **A doctor’s order entry system** (custom OpenMRS module)
    
* **A Mirth Connect HL7v2 → FHIR translator**
    
* **A FHIR R4 API that populated downstream EMRs**
    

A clinician entered:

```plaintext
textCopyEditParacetamol 0mg PO BID × 3 days
```

They used `0mg` to **pause** the medication temporarily — clearly noted in the written instruction.

---

## ❌ What Went Wrong?

Here’s the simplified flow:

### 1\. **HL7v2 ORC/RXE Segment Sent to Mirth**

```plaintext
hl7CopyEditRXE|^^^Paracetamol|0|mg|...
```

### 2\. **Mirth JavaScript Transformer (Inbound)**

```plaintext
jsCopyEditvar dosage = msg['RXE']['GiveAmountMinimum'].toString();
if (!dosage) {
    msg['RXE']['GiveAmountMinimum'] = null;
}
```

> **Failure Point:** `0` is falsy in JavaScript. The logic treated `0` as *no input*, and discarded it.

### 3\. **FHIR MedicationRequest Created**

```plaintext
jsonCopyEdit{
  "resourceType": "MedicationRequest",
  "status": "active",
  "medicationCodeableConcept": {
    "text": "Paracetamol"
  },
  "dosageInstruction": []
}
```

### 4\. **Downstream EMR Logic**

* The absence of `dosageInstruction` was interpreted as: *doctor didn't provide dosage*
    
* System defaulted to **continue the last known dosage**
    
* Patient continued to receive **500mg PO BID** from a prior order
    

---

## 💥 Consequences

* Medication **was not held** as the clinician intended
    
* Nurses administered doses believing the order was active
    
* **Adverse drug event** occurred due to an unintended continuous dose
    
* Audit logs showed the doctor entered “0mg”, but **no record** made it into the EMR or registry
    

---

## ✅ What We Learned (Hard)

### 1\. `0` is Data — Not Empty

Never treat `0` as falsy without domain context.

> **Rule**: In medication logic, `0mg` is **valid and intentional**.

### 2\. UI Must Accept and Display Zeroes

Many UIs use this logic:

```plaintext
jsCopyEditif (!input) { throw "Field is required"; }
```

This prevents clinicians from entering `0` when they mean “hold” or “stop”.

Fix:

```plaintext
jsCopyEditif (input === null || input === undefined || input === '') {
    throw "Field is required";
}
```

### 3\. FHIR Supports `0` as Dosage

The FHIR `Dosage.doseAndRate.doseQuantity.value` **can** be `0`.

```plaintext
jsonCopyEdit{
  "dosageInstruction": [
    {
      "doseAndRate": [
        {
          "doseQuantity": {
            "value": 0,
            "unit": "mg"
          }
        }
      ],
      "text": "Temporarily stop Paracetamol"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4\. HL7v2 Mapping Must Respect Intent

Our Mirth channel now includes:

```plaintext
jsCopyEditvar dosage = msg['RXE']['GiveAmountMinimum'].toString();
if (dosage === '') {
    msg['RXE']['GiveAmountMinimum'] = null;
}
```

We also log all zero-dosage entries explicitly for clinical audit.

---

## 🔒 Final Fix: UI + Backend Contract

1. **Clinicians** can now enter `0mg` and select "Hold Medication"
    
2. **FHIR backend** maps `0` properly into `MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction`
    
3. **EMRs** are trained to treat `0mg` as **“temporarily held”**, not missing
    
4. We introduced a `MedicationRequest.statusReason` to give extra context like:
    

```plaintext
jsonCopyEdit"statusReason": {
  "text": "Held due to liver enzyme elevation"
}
```

## 🔁 Closing Thought

In digital health, **0 is not nothing**.  
Zero may mean: pause, defer, hold, suspend — but **never ignore**.

> A small `0` broke the chain. Fixing it made the whole system safer.

### 🔧 Tools Involved:

* Mirth Connect 3.12
    
* FHIR R4 (HAPI FHIR Server)
    
* OpenMRS custom form entry module
    
* JSONPath + HL7 JavaScript transformers
