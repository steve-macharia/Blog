In many parts of **Kenya and East Africa**, accessing timely, quality healthcare remains a persistent challengeâ€”especially in **rural and underserved communities**. Long travel distances, limited clinical staff, and inadequate health infrastructure often create significant barriers for patients and providers alike.

To address these challenges, **Medby** is expanding **Jali-EMR** with a powerful new **telehealth module**â€”bringing **real-time virtual care**, **secure health data**, and **seamless mobile billing** to the last mile. This transformative solution is designed to empower Kenyan healthcare workers, improve patient outcomes, and close care gaps in even the most remote areas.

## What Makes This Telehealth Platform Unique?

Our telehealth solution is built **from the ground up** for **Kenyaâ€™s healthcare environment**, combining:  
âœ… **Jali-EMR**: A robust, Kenyan-developed **Electronic Medical Records (EMR)** system  
âœ… **Teleconsultation tools**: Secure, real-time **video consultations** powered by **WebRTC**  
âœ… **Mobile-first access**: Browser-based support for **smartphones and tablets**  
âœ… **M-PESA billing integration**: Simple, fast, and secure mobile payments  
âœ… **SHA-compliant patient identification**: Ensuring continuity of care across health systems

By embedding teleconsultation directly into the EMR, clinicians can manage both **in-person** and **virtual patients** from a single, unified interfaceâ€”streamlining workflows and reducing errors.

## Bringing Telehealth to Rural Kenya

The new **Jali-EMR telehealth module** is specifically designed for:

* **Rural clinics and health centers**
    
* **Community health programs**
    
* **Mobile outreach units**
    

With **low-bandwidth optimization**, our system ensures that even facilities with **unstable internet connections** can participate in virtual care. Additionally, our **offline-first workflows** allow health workers to:

* **Record consultations**
    
* **Capture clinical data**
    
* **Queue prescriptions, lab requests, and referrals**
    

All actions are **automatically synchronized** once connectivity is restoredâ€”ensuring that no patient is left behind.

## Seamless Clinical Workflows with Interoperability

Our teleconsultation platform supports key clinical functions:  
âœ… Generate and transmit **e-prescriptions**  
âœ… Order **laboratory tests and referrals**  
âœ… Share data as **HL7 FHIR bundles** for interoperability with **Kenyaâ€™s national health systems**

This level of integration ensures that patient care remains **consistent, continuous, and connected**â€”whether delivered **in-person or remotely**.

## Enhancing Care with AI and Decision Support

To assist healthcare providers in real-time decision-making, we are embedding **AI-powered clinical decision support tools** within the telehealth experience. These tools help:

* Identify **early signs of illness**
    
* Prioritize **critical cases**
    
* Support **non-communicable disease (NCD) management**
    

With **remote vitals capture** and intelligent decision aids, clinicians can deliver higher quality careâ€”even from a distance.

## M-PESA Billing for Affordable, Accessible Care

Weâ€™ve integrated **M-PESA mobile payments** directly into the telehealth module, making it easy for patients to:

* **Book virtual appointments**
    
* **Pay for consultations**
    
* **Receive follow-up care**
    

This allows for **transparent, cashless transactions**â€”critical for increasing access while reducing administrative burdens on facilities.

* **Telehealth**
    
* **EMR systems**
    
* **Mobile payments**
