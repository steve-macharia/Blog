If you’re a developer building anything that handles **money** — payment apps, e-commerce platforms, fintech software — here’s a golden rule:

👉 **Never use floating-point numbers to represent money.**

Sounds extreme? Let me explain.

## ⚡ The Float Trap

In most programming languages, real numbers (decimals) are stored as **binary floating-point** values following the IEEE-754 standard.

The problem? Many decimal fractions **cannot be represented exactly** in binary.

Take this innocent example in Python:

```plaintext
print(0.1 + 0.2)        # 0.30000000000000004
print(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3) # False
```

Wait… what? `0.1 + 0.2` isn’t equal to `0.3`?

That tiny rounding error may seem harmless, but imagine it happening across **millions of financial transactions**. Suddenly, those “tiny” cents can snowball into serious legal and financial trouble.

That’s why devs joke:

> *“If you use floats for money, you’ll go to jail.”* 😅

Of course, you won’t literally get arrested — but your company might!

## 🛠️ The Right Way to Handle Money

### 1\. Use Integers (Store in Smallest Units)

A common approach is to store money as **integers in the smallest unit** (like cents instead of dollars).

```plaintext
# Instead of $10.55
amount = 1055  # cents
```

This way, calculations stay exact, because integers don’t suffer from floating-point rounding.

---

### 2\. Use Decimal / BigDecimal

Most modern languages give you a **decimal or fixed-point type** for exact base-10 arithmetic.

#### ✅ Python

```plaintext
from decimal import Decimal

a = Decimal("0.10")
b = Decimal("0.20")
c = Decimal("0.30")

print(a + b == c)  # True
```

#### ✅ Java

```plaintext
import java.math.BigDecimal;

BigDecimal a = new BigDecimal("0.10");
BigDecimal b = new BigDecimal("0.20");
BigDecimal c = new BigDecimal("0.30");

System.out.println(a.add(b).equals(c)); // true
```

⚠️ Pro tip: Always construct decimals from **strings**, not floats.

```plaintext
print(Decimal(0.1))   # 0.10000000000000000555
print(Decimal("0.1")) # 0.1
```

## 🚨 Real-World Consequences

Financial systems that mishandle decimals have caused bugs ranging from **miscalculated invoices** to **regulatory violations**. Even a tiny error like `$0.0001` across billions of transactions can mean **millions in losses** — and yes, lawsuits.

So when money’s on the line:

* 🚫 Don’t trust floats.
    
* ✅ Use integers or decimals.
    
* 🛡️ Protect yourself (and your users) from subtle rounding errors.
    

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaway

* Floats are great for physics, graphics, and scientific calculations.
    
* But for **money**, **precision matters more than speed**.
    
* Treat financial values as integers (cents) or use high-precision decimal types.
    

Because at the end of the day:  
👉 *Your users (and auditors) care about every cent.*
