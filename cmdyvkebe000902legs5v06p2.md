*Published on August 5, 2025 by* ***Stephen Macharia***

I’ve been coding in PHP for a few years now, mostly working with Laravel, WordPress, and sometimes just raw PHP scripts. But for the longest time, my experience in **Visual Studio Code** felt a bit incomplete.

That changed when I discovered **PHP Intelephense**.

In this post, I’ll share how Intelephense has become my daily companion and how it’s genuinely helped me grow as a PHP developer.

---

## 🚀 First Impressions: From Basic to Brilliant

When I first installed VS Code, PHP support felt a little…meh.

There was syntax highlighting, sure. But not much else. No real-time feedback, no autocomplete for classes, no hint if I made a mistake — unless I ran the script in the browser (or worse, production 😅).

Then I found **Intelephense** on the VS Code Marketplace. I installed it, restarted VS Code, and… boom — everything changed.

---

## 🧠 Smarter Autocomplete = Fewer Headaches

One of the first things I noticed was **intelligent autocomplete**.

Typing `$user = new Us` would instantly suggest `UserController`, `UserFactory`, and even models from `App\Models`. It knew what I was trying to write — even before I did sometimes!

This alone has saved me countless hours and reduced silly typos that used to take forever to debug.

---

## 🛠️ Real-Time Error Checking

Before Intelephense, I’d often write entire functions only to realize I had a missing semicolon, used an undefined variable, or forgot to return a value.

Now? I get **red squiggly lines** immediately when something’s off — even before saving the file. It’s like having a mini code reviewer watching over my shoulder (but way less annoying).

---

## 🔍 Navigating Code Like a Pro

Working on larger Laravel projects used to be frustrating. I’d lose track of where functions were defined or which file a class belonged to.

With Intelephense, I can:

* **Go to Definition** (`F12`)
    
* **Peek Definition**
    
* **Find All References**
    

This has made working on complex codebases much smoother and less intimidating.

---

## 🗂️ Understanding Other People’s Code

A lot of my work involves maintaining or contributing to existing projects. Before, reading someone else’s PHP code felt like decoding ancient symbols.

Now with Intelephense, hovering over functions and classes shows me **documentation, types, and definitions** — all inline. It helps me understand the flow of a project quickly, even if I didn’t write it.

---

## ⚙️ Personal Tweaks That Help

I’ve also customized a few settings to make Intelephense even better:

```plaintext
jsonCopyEdit{
  "intelephense.environment.includePaths": [
    "vendor/laravel/framework"
  ],
  "intelephense.files.exclude": [
    "**/.git/**",
    "**/node_modules/**",
    "**/vendor/**"
  ]
}
```

This keeps things fast and focused on the files that matter.

---

## 💸 Bonus: It's Free (Mostly)

What I love most? The **core version is completely free**. And even though there’s a paid version, I’ve been able to do **almost everything I need** with the free one.

That said, the Pro license is affordable and unlocks some powerful refactoring tools — I’m seriously considering getting it soon.

---

## 🧩 Part of a Bigger Workflow

Intelephense has become a core part of my VS Code setup, along with:

* **PHP CS Fixer** – for automatic code formatting
    
* **PHP Debug** – for XDebug integration
    
* **Laravel Blade Snippets** – for Blade templating
    

Together, these tools have made PHP development in VS Code feel like a full IDE experience — lightweight, fast, and tailored to how I work.

---

## 👨‍💻 Final Thoughts

PHP Intelephense didn’t just make my editor smarter — it made **me** a better, more confident developer.

I spend less time hunting bugs, navigating blindly, or wondering why my code isn’t working. And I get more time doing what I love: building and improving apps.

If you're a PHP developer using VS Code and haven’t installed Intelephense yet, you’re seriously missing out. Go grab it. You’ll thank yourself later.
