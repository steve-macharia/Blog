Kenya is at the forefront of digital health innovation in Africa, with significant strides made in 2025 to enhance healthcare delivery through technology. Here's an overview of the key developments shaping the digital health landscape in Kenya:

### 1\. **AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support**

In a groundbreaking study, Penda Health, a network of primary care clinics in Nairobi, partnered with OpenAI to deploy "AI Consult," an AI tool designed to assist clinicians during patient visits. The tool operates silently in the background, providing corrective prompts when potentially incorrect decisions are made. This real-world application resulted in a 16% reduction in diagnostic errors and a 13% decrease in treatment errors among clinicians using the tool. Additionally, clinicians reported that the AI Consult served as a valuable educational resource, enhancing their confidence and expanding their medical knowledge.

### 2\. **Regulatory Advancements in Digital Health**

Kenya has introduced new regulations to establish a robust framework for digital health services. These regulations facilitate the registration of patients, tracking of health records, and streamlining healthcare processes. By implementing these regulations, Kenya aims to accelerate progress in addressing health priorities in alignment with major national development frameworks, such as Vision 2030 and the Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA), where healthcare is a critical focus.
