### 1\. The Three-Tier Configuration — OpenEMR Procedures Module

OpenEMR supports a structured, three-tier setup in its Procedures module:

* **Tier 1 (Group):** A top-level category like "Annual PE Labs" — purely for grouping.
    
* **Tier 2 (Procedure Order):** An orderable test such as "CBC" under that group.
    
* **Tier 3 (Discrete Results):** Specific analytes like WBC and RBC nested under the procedure order.

This is the exact structure we’ve been using with our CBC example.

### 2\. How it Works in Practice

#### Configuration Steps from OpenEMR Wiki:

1. Navigate to **Procedures → Configuration → Add Top Level (Group)**.
    
2. Under the group, click `[Add]` to create the **Procedure Order**.
    
3. Under the procedure order, click `[Add]` again and select **Discrete Result** to define actual test components (e.g., WBC, RBC).  
    This mirrors exactly our CBC breakdown.

### 3\. Ordering Workflow & UI Behavior

* Once configured, the **Procedure Order** (Tier 2) becomes searchable and orderable from a patient’s encounter.
    
* When ordered, all Tier 3 discrete results are bundled and shown for entry in **Procedures → Pending Review**.

This matches how you’d enter CBC results: order the CBC, then enter values for WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin, etc.

### 4\. Sequence Control & Panel Ordering

OpenEMR sorts items within tiers using the **sequence** value:

* By default, Tier 3 entries may be listed alphabetically, which can disrupt panel layout.
    
* You can override this behavior by specifying the `sequence` field when configuring, making panels appear in the desired order.  
    This was confirmed through community discussion and code insights.

### 5\. Known Limitations & Real-World Caveats

* **User complaints:** Some developers report the lab module isn’t user-friendly or flexible for workflows like gender-specific ranges or dynamic test panels.

* **Module complexity:** Limitations exist in the design, prompting some implementers to recommend customized code or new logic entirely.

## Putting It All Together: CBC Example Recap (Anchored in OpenEMR Functionality)

1. **Tier 1 (Group):** e.g., *Hematology Tests* — added via "Add Top Level".
    
2. **Tier 2 (Procedure Order):** *CBC* — appears in clinician's encounter list once configured.
    
3. **Tier 3 (Discrete Results):** *WBC*, *RBC*, *Hemoglobin*, *Platelets* — added as discrete results under CBC.
    

Actions after configuration:

* Clinician orders **CBC** within an encounter.
    
* At **Procedures → Pending Review**, staff enters each Tier 3 value.
    
* Once validated, the result is marked **Final** or **Corrected** as needed.
